- iterative and incremental approach

- approach to software development and project management that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. 

- The Agile methodology aims to deliver small, functional increments of a project frequently, allowing for rapid adaptation to changing requirements.

- Iterative Development: Agile projects are broken down into small increments or iterations, typically lasting 2-4 weeks (Sprints).

Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). Each of these frameworks provides specific practices and roles within the Agile principles.

- framework refers to a pre-established structure or set of guidelines that provides a foundation for developing software applications, building projects, or organizing tasks.

KANBAN   -  Kanban is a visual management method for improving work processes.
		The key aspect of Kanban is visualizing the work, limiting work in progress, and continuously improving the flow.

- In Kanban, a "post-it" typically refers to a sticky note sed on a physical Kanban board to represent a task or work item.
		in post-it si mette anche il percentuale di avanzamento, quanto lavoro sia fatto.
		
	TO DO COLUMN: This is where new tasks are initially placed. Each task is written on a post-it and stuck in the "To Do" column, indicating that it's ready to be worked on.

	IN PROGRESS COLUMN: As a team member starts working on a task, the corresponding post-it is moved to the "In Progress" column. This visually signals that the task is actively being worked on.

	DONE COLUMN: Once a task is completed, its post-it is moved to the "Done" column. This column represents tasks that have been finished and are ready for review or deployment.
	
In Kanban:
1.) Visualization (typically consists of columns representing different stages of the workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done.")
2.) Work in Progress (WIP) Limits
3.) Pull System
4.) Continuous Improvement
5.) Flexibility
6.) Collaboration
